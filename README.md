This is the code and data for:

Owens, Barnard, Muscheler, Herbst, Lockwood, Usoskin and Asvestari (2024), "A Geomagnetic Estimate of Heliospheric Modulation Potential Over the Last 175 Years" Solar Physics, in press.

Because of these dependencies, the simplest way is to use conda to create a virtual environment. We recommend using and up-to-date version of miniconda. With the anaconda prompt, in the root directory of repositroy, this can be done as:

```
>>conda env create -f environment.yml
>>conda activate huxt
``` 

Then run ModulationPotential_Geomagnetic.py in the code directory. All data and supporting libraries are provided.
